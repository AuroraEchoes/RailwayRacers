# Railway Racers

**Note**: Railway Racers is best played on desktop playforms, as they support the use of Godot’s *Forward+* rendering pipeline.

**Railway Racers is a real-time train logistics puzzle game.

This game was made for the [UTS Playmakers August Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/playmakers-august-game-jam), using the Godot game engine. The theme for this jam was “three-dimensional puzzle game.”

This repository contains the source code for the game. Truly, it is some of the worst code I've ever written —  but, if for some reason, you feel compelled to investigate the secrets behind elusive functions, such as `find_path_but_dont_let_the_stupid_fucking_train_do_a_180_and_combust()` or `_throw_that_pokeball_babyyyy()` —  or simply wish to observe my insanity growing through code comments, then you may peruse this garbage at your wish.

Note: I decided that the music didn't fit the vibe of the game, so it is muted by default. However you can change that in the settings menu.
